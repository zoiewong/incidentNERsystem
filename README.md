AI empowered incident reporting and learning system 

This is the source code of a demo system on incident reporting. 
There are three phases of reporting, namely: reporting the incident, structuring free-text report, and recommending learning resources. Through the backend BERT model, the system can automatically capture information from unstructured, free-text incident reports and render it as structured data (Japanese text only).
